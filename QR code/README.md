# QR Code in PDF

Sometimes we need to generate a PDF file containing a QR Code image in it. This was happened to me, so I made this PHP scripts.

Basically, I need to generate a QR Code image in a directory, then I generate a PDF file containing that generated QR Code image.

This program is using these libraries:
